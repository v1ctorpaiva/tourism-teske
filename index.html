						<h2 class="mx-auto bottommargin font-body" style="max-width: 700px; font-size: 40px;">This Is Our Canada</h2>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							The history of Canada that you will find here is of a new country, which was wrong and wrong in many aspects. But that today, it is willing to learn and welcome everything and everyone as a kind nation, with equality, democracy, and transparency. Fighting every day for the inclusion of diversity.
						</p>


						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Canada seeks those immigrants who are part of this country and add to the nation in search of a better world for all. Which has a not-so-distant past in terms of discrimination, flaws in human rights, and social inequality. Social rights as well-being, housing, education, and food needs.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							The struggle for these rights was led by the socialist and labor parties, to seek equality of necessary resources. Since a confederation, the 150 years by the confederation of ups and downs.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 680px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
							<i>What does the resulting poverty look like? It has an Indigenous face, for example. A 2016 study found that Indigenous children are twice as likely to live in poverty as non-Indigenous children: the poverty rate for children on reserves is 60 percent. Children of immigrants have a poverty rate of 32 percent. By comparison, children who are non-Indigenous, non-racialized, and non-immigrant have a poverty rate of 13 percent. All of these numbers are too high. And children are poor because their parents. (Young & Broadbent, 2017).</i>
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Unfortunately, today we still have Canadians who do not tolerate immigrants and do not want to participate in the struggle for equality. But the number according to research is decreasing with each passing day. Canadians, in general, were very warm to welcome thousands of Syrian refugees and with that, it shows us that we are walking towards the country we want to be.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 680px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
							<i>Canada’s soul is up for grabs. We need to remind ourselves of the better part of our history and our political culture. Social and economic rights—nuanced by feminists and others—need to re-emerge as common expectations, fulfilled and embraced by both our governments and our courts. (Young & Broadbent, 2017)</i>

						<h2 class="mx-auto bottommargin font-body" style="max-width: 700px; font-size: 40px;">The Indigenous History</h2>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							For you who arrived now and for all the immigrants that Canada receives and me when I arrived, I can imagine that the curiosity about this country only grows, am I correct? That is why I want to talk about when it all started.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							The first inhabitants of Canada were the aborigines, who were probably of Asian origin and would have crossed a strip of land between Siberia and Alaska.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 680px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
							<i>The First Peoples of this land now known as Canada formerly had unique communities with unique names - there wasn’t a need for collective nouns or complicated terminology. With European contact and ensuing colonization, the government required people to be defined and labeled for ease of governing. (Joseph,2018)</i>
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							In Canada, each people who arrived to inhabit that particular place discovered what the place had to offer. Thus, fishing, hunting, and gathering were central to all indigenous societies, however, they always looked for and did some specific activities according to each territory, such as art materials, clothes, bison hunting, and plantations.
						</p>
						
						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Because they moved seasonally to seek food and other natural supplies, most of these nations were considered semi-nomadic.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 680px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
							<i>The Indian Act is the primary law the federal government uses to administer Indian status, local First Nations governments and the management of reserve land. It also outlines governmental obligations to First Nations peoples. (Henderson, 2006)</i>
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							The federal government created a law that was used to administer the status of Indians, First Nations, and the management of reserve lands. 
							The Law was created and called the Indian Act and has had several changes since the beginning, this law aimed to give power to the government to impose rules, make cultural changes, and interfere in education.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Indigenous people were greatly harmd by this law because they prohibited cultural customs, such as dancing, and even the obligation of children to be forcibly taken from their families with the guarantee that they would be part of school education, and in fact, schools forced children to lose their customs and try to insert them into a reality that the Indians did not approve of. These children were abused.
							The Law also stated that it was illegal for communities to hire lawyers to make land claims without the consent of the government.	All these policies have had very negative impacts on indigenous peoples for generations.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Residential schools in Canada were created by Christian churches with the help of the Canadian government to sponsor, with an initiative and attempt to convert indigenous people to Christian culture and try to insert them into Canadian society. The first Canadian residential school opened in 1831 under the name of Mohawk Institute after 10 years, in 1931, there were a total of 80 residential schools operating in Canada, that number was the biggest number registered. In 1996, Gordon Residential School was the last federally funded residential school in Canada. The purpose of residential schools was to bring children into society, as a way to help indigenous people but, behind that, the objective of the federal government was to reduce the indigenous dependence on public money, making the first nations self-sufficient.
						</p>

						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Life in the residential schools before the reports of people who lived and the facts were extremely cruel. Children are forced to work to bear the costs of schools, with total disregard for customs, beliefs, and cultures. Tortured for having been forced to cut their hair without their authorization, and the culture about haircuts means the loss of loved ones and close ones. Abused by sexual predators, chained by people who didn't have the necessary skills, and physically abused. They were humiliated for being forced not to speak their native language, as many children were unable to communicate in English or French. The tasks were separated by gender, where the girls had the work of taking care of the house, cooking, washing, and sewing and the boys learned about construction, maintenance, and agricultural work. That tasks where the church places the woman submissive to the man, without the right to choose. Women still struggle today for egalitarianism and the power of choice.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							The role of religion in residential schools was under pressure. Churches tried at all costs to get rid of indigenous cultures and impose the Catholic religion in a completely forced way.  According to the text and several testimonies from people who lived through this phase, all followed their adult lives bringing traumas that will never be forgotten. Because, according to studies, our childhood is a fundamental part for us to learn and take lessons for the rest of our lives. These people who have gone through this, will never be able to forget what they lived, the traumas suffered and the abuses they were forced to go through. These children suffered spiritual, cultural, physical as well as emotional abuse from the churches from using chemical substances in their hair, separation from family, siblings, and loved ones, blackboards where they put the names of those who were going to heaven and who were going to hell, being called by numbers and not by name, and being exposed to the body of another colleague whom he had committed suicide for not having endured all this terror. They were children and they were exposed to it. In other words, how would these people be able to live a normal life after that?
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 680px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
							<i>The legacy of these schools and the suffering they inflicted continues to reverberate within Indigenous communities today. The task of remediation and reconciliation must fall to all Canadians. And it has only just begun. (Harrys et al.,2017)</i>
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							The Catholic Church's apology did not happen until today, 2022. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reported that he regretted the Pope's and the Catholic Church's refusal to acknowledge their responsibility to indigenous people. The Pope refused to come to Canada and made a statement saying that he expressed his solidarity with the Canadian people and that he hoped that the political and religious authorities of Canada would continue to work together to shed light on this sad affair and embark on a path of reconciliation. At no time until today, it was said that he apologized in the name of the Church for the events, on parcels of doubts, or the responsibility of the Church. The Church's apology would be useful in the reconciliation process, as with it, the Church would be taking its share of the blame towards the schools. For the indigenous people, the Pope's apology on behalf of all Catholic churches would be essential to begin the process of healing and reconciliation. But it would be true if it were on Canadian soil, which the Pope refused to do.

						<h2 class="mx-auto bottommargin font-body" style="max-width: 700px; font-size: 40px;">The Great Nation Of Immigrants</h2>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Unlike many countries, Canada is divided into provinces. The provinces are demarcated by territories and have their own way of dealing, judging, and coordinating the place, with this, the government has autonomy over that specific province. As a result, there are several provinces with completely different laws spread across Canada.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Canada is the result of disputes between French and English colonists. Most of the Canadian population has English as their native language, but we have a province whose main language is French, yet most of the population is fluent in both languages. But the Francophone province created laws to protect the French language.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							The division of land in Canada began with New France, the name given to the present-day province of Quebec when they took over that part of the land that was discovered in 1608. After this event, Great Britain gained most of the control after winning the land dispute with France.
						</p>

							<i>Constitutional monarchy is Canada’s system of government. An absolute monarchy is one where the monarch has unchecked power. A constitutional monarch, in contrast, is limited by the laws of the Constitution. Constitutional monarchs do not directly rule. Instead, they carry out constitutional, ceremonial and representational duties. Canada’s monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, is the head of state. The prime minister is the head of government. The monarch is represented by the governor general at the federal level and by lieutenant-governors in the provinces. (Constitutional Monarchy | The Canadian Encyclopedia, n.d.)</i>

							The Canadian population was growing and the natives who lived in Canada were losing their space. Great Britain granted Canada the right to have its own constitution, becoming an independent country. 
						</p>
						
						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							As for immigrants, not all immigrants from Canada were Europeans. They also had many blacks coming from Africa as slaves, Jews, and Asians in particular. When slavery was abolished in Canada, many blacks from the United States fled to Canada as well.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 680px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
							<i>The discovery of gold in present-day British Columbia’s Fraser River valley in 1857 initiated the beginning of significant Chinese immigration to the region, which increased when thousands of Chinese workers arrived in the early 1880s to build the Canadian Pacific Railway. By the time the railway was completed in 1885, fervent anti-Chinese racism in British Columbia impelled the introduction of the federal Chinese Head Tax that year. (See also Anti-Asian Racism.) Originally set at $50, this entry tax for Chinese immigrants was eventually increased to $500, and remained in effect until the introduction of the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which barred most new Chinese settlement in Canada. While 39,000 people of Chinese origin lived in Canada in 1921, Chinese exclusion halted population growth to approximately 32,000 by the time the Act was repealed in 1947. (Wallace, 2018)</i>
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							The territorial consolidation of Canada could not be talked about or thought of without the Chinese manpower. The Chinese came to Canada looking for a new start in life and unfortunately, they encountered deep cultural and racial rejection. The Chinese Exclusion Act was made to prohibit the entry of Chinese immigrants, they were banned and attacked by the Canadian KKK who insisted on an exclusively white country.
							Multiculturalism was an issue with many different opinions between the population and provinces. 
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 680px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
							<i>Canada’s current immigration framework was assembled in the 1960s. In an era of greater liberalism, geographical preference for immigrants from Europe and the United States was ended, and the points system was introduced, allowing entry to any qualified candidates. By the 1970s, the three streams of current immigration policy were in place: admission was possible through the points system for economic migrants (the independent or economic class), through family sponsorship (the family class), and through need for protection (the humanitarian class). (Ley, 2017)</i>
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							The focus on immigration was modified and complemented by the adoption of a new policy that also confirmed English and French as the two official languages in the country. Therefore, immigrants were invited to come to Canada and bring their culture, clothes, beliefs, and other customs with them.

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Canada is unique in its multiculturalism, as most countries prefer to define themselves by a single set. 
							Quebec for example opposes multiculturalism stating that it threatens the protection of the French language. Many citizens were also opposed, because according to their thinking, diversity creates a society in which they live locked in their own ethnic silo, instead of coming together as one. Thus, they believed that multiculturalism did not bring strength but weakness to this society.

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Canadian society has great diversity, with indigenous bases, English and French origins, and great multiculturalism of immigrants.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							We, humans, are unique, with our beliefs, cultures, sexual orientation, and choice of religion. However, even if we are unique, we can always connect with other people who have in some way the same thought or who have experienced the same event.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							In unequal societies, it can be more difficult to connect in some factors, but in others, even if you don't share the same thought, if you lived that moment, you can certainly connect to what happened.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							In a society like Canada, for example, which historically placed the interest of men over that of women, we also know that a black person lives differently from a white person and that a Muslim lives differently from a Christian.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 680px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
							<i>Revolution is not the result of a small number of individual women with high profiles working hard, although that can undoubtedly help. It is the consequence of millions of women who have, over the last 150 years, got out of bed (then likely made that bed, the beds of other family members, and breakfast, then washed the dishes, carried out the compost, and packed lunches, all before the day for some people begins) and did what they saw needed to be done. Women like those profiled above. We owe them gratitude. (Brooks, 2017)</i>
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Women have suffered and still suffer today for the struggle for Equity and Equality. In 1867 Canadian ideology was known for separate spheres, where men were responsible for political affairs, paid work, had the right to vote, and could run for public office, while women were assigned to domestic tasks, such as taking care of the house, children, cook, laundry, and could not express their opinion, did not have the right to vote and were not recognized by the law as persons.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Some women began to challenge this system, and with that, the movement came to be called first-wave feminism and they got the right to vote. 
							The government at the time, to gain support, extended the right to women who had children or siblings who were serving in the armed forces, to have the right to vote, as they would endorse recruitment.

						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 680px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
							<i>Reactions to the Famous Five have varied widely. Their contribution to the development of women’s rights in Canada was recognized in 2000 with the dedication of a bronze statue called Women Are Persons! by Edmonton artist Barbara Paterson in Ottawa and Calgary (1999). The Famous 5 Foundation was established on 18 October 1996, the 65th anniversary of the Persons Case. Its mandate is to “empower women and girls to courageously lead change that contributes to a society without boundaries for women.”. (Cavanaugh, 2020)</i>
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							After a judge was banned from holding her position because she was a woman, "FAMOUS FIVE" fought for recognition to Canada's highest court.	Even with the right to vote and being able to run for public office, women were still not considered persons before the law. 
							The decision of this fight granted legal personality not only to women in Canada but throughout the British community. 
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							During the great war, women managed to fill some vacancies to work outside the home, replacing men, but when men returned from the war, they expelled women from positions, causing ideology to return. After that, many women began to demand work outside the home and fought to achieve equality in work, in salary, and the end of inequality by sex.
							The third wave of feminism not only had white women like the first and second, but now also included women of different races, religions, and classes. The Canadian government adopted the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to fight for equality.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 680px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
							<i>While lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Canadians have always been engaged in artistic discourse, it was only in the 1960s and 1970s that alternative sexualities were openly portrayed in ways that directly challenged the mainstream establishment. Ever since, queer artists have played an integral role in the movement for LGBT rights in Canada, and today continue to challenge not only homophobia but also colonialism, racism and sexism. (Block, 2015)</i>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							In 2005, the Canadian government allowed same-sex marriage, making Canada the fourth country in the world to legalize it. LGBTQ+ pride in the country started with protests during the 1970s and 1980s and only in the 1990s did it start to gain support from some local governments. Nowadays, the celebration attracts millions of people that takes place once a year in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							Canada has created protection against discrimination called the Charter of Rights and Freedom for all residents of Canada based on age, race, sex, or religion. Even though the letter offers different types of protection, those who are still experiencing inequality in the economy. More than 10% of the population lives below the poverty line.
						</p>

						<p class="lead mx-auto" style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
							The solution to poverty must be found at the political level, but until now the Canadian system and government have not shown any position to address the causes of economic inequality. The country's social class is the biggest predictor of life prospects. The letter does not recognize that Canadians are entitled to the minimum income level.
